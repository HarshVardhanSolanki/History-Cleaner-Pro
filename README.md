# 🧹 History Cleaner Pro

Bulk delete Chrome history entries with precision and speed.

**History Cleaner Pro** is a lightweight Chrome extension that lets you search your browsing history and remove multiple entries at once using a simple “Select All” option. It solves the repetitive, manual checkbox clicking required in Chrome’s default history page.
